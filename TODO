# Move all the utility functions to phonegui
# make a special source for weird string functions
# Make a g_value_safe_get_value and put it in the same file with the other gvalue funcs.
# Fix the g_value mess, internal design does NOT use g_values and when getting data from dbus function that do, just use a wrapper to modifiy.
# Write sfree (i.e- safe free) that checks that the value is not null before freing maybe even a macro that also sets to null afterwards.

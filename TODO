# Move all the utility functions to phonegui
# make a special source for weird string functions
# Make a g_value_safe_get_value and put it in the same file with the other gvalue funcs.
# Fix the g_value mess, internal design does NOT use g_values and when getting data from dbus function that do, just use a wrapper to modifiy.
# Write sfree (i.e- safe free) that checks that the value is not null before freing maybe even a macro that also sets to null afterwards.
# Fix the mess with hash tables in call-* and probably everywhere else as well, atm we don't free just allocate, a lot, even when there's no real need.
# When calling cross frame functions (i.e contacts from dialer and etc, use phoneui_* functions and *not* frame show functions)
#order the mess in the makefile.am's split into dirs
#Remove the ugly hack from views.h (and actually drop most of it entirely)

Notes from max_posedon:
[08:56]   max_posedon | 1. it sometimes haven't enough time to register to GSM at phone start
[08:57]   max_posedon | 2. it doesn't shows incomming sms, I see "1 new message" at home screen, press it -nothing
[08:58]   max_posedon | 3. shr-messages/shr-contacts empty at first start
[09:00]   max_posedon | 4. shr-messages in "list" doesn't show contact names, only phone numbers
[09:01]   max_posedon | 5. shr-messages on "new sms" line-wrap is very small, near 10 I think

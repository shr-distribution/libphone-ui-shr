# Move all the utility functions to phonegui
# make a special source for weird string functions
# Make a g_value_safe_get_value and put it in the same file with the other gvalue funcs.
# Fix the g_value mess, internal design does NOT use g_values and when getting data from dbus function that do, just use a wrapper to modifiy.
# Write sfree (i.e- safe free) that checks that the value is not null before freing maybe even a macro that also sets to null afterwards.
# Fix the mess with hash tables in call-* and probably everywhere else as well, atm we don't free just allocate, a lot, even when there's no real need.
# When calling cross frame functions (i.e contacts from dialer and etc, use phoneui_* functions and *not* frame show functions)
